                        <h2>The Shift Behind AL-SHIFT</h2>
                        <blockquote>"Learning is not just content—it's a strategy for transformation."</blockquote>
                        <p>I'm a learning strategist, facilitator, and programme designer with over 15 years of international experience working at the intersection of education, human rights, youth empowerment, and innovation.</p>
                        <p>AL-SHIFT Consulting was born from years of working alongside communities, educators, and changemakers across diverse regions and realities. Over time, I saw a clear need: for learning that is not only innovative, but also inclusive, agile, and deeply rooted in context.</p>
                        <p>Too often, learning solutions are designed in isolation from the people they aim to serve. AL-SHIFT is my response to that, an invitation to do things differently. To co-create experiences that adapt to complexity, honour lived experiences, and drive meaningful, lasting transformation.</p>
                        <p>This work is more than a profession, it's a purpose. And it's built on the belief that learning, when done right, can be one of the most powerful tools for equity, empowerment, and change.</p>
                        <p>Before launching AL-SHIFT, I held leadership roles with local, regional and international organisations. I've led initiatives in STEAM education, life skills, social innovation, and Human Rights across the MENA region, especially in complex or fragile environments.</p>
                        <p>I'm passionate about designing learning experiences that are not only innovative but also deeply human. I've developed curricula, facilitated trainings, and managed programmes, all rooted in a belief that learning, when done right, can be one of the most powerful tools for transformation.</p>
                        <p>With degrees from the University of Amsterdam, University College London, and Birzeit University, and a background in education, international development, architecture and museum studies, I bring an interdisciplinary lens to every project I work on.</p>
